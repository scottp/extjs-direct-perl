EXTJS-REMOTE-PERL
==============================================================================

ExtJS-remote-perl is a minimal implementation of the Ext.Direct server side
stack. Originally this has been written as a reference implementation. The
simple version is as short as possible and requires only the JSON library. More
complicated version which incorporate access control and introspection have
been started.

==============================================================================
Versions
==============================================================================

simple/
	A simple implementation using the least amount of code, but still being
	basically reliable and secure. This implementation is useful as a basis
	for starting other development systems.

acl/
	Based on simple, but also includes ability to do basic access controls
	on each method - thus providing a security above the application layer.

test/
	Test Javascript and HTML. You will also need ExtJS 3.n



==============================================================================
Performance Improvements
==============================================================================

	- If API is introspective, it must be cached
	- Each request could be done concurrently - when to create a thread?
	- Keep the objects in stash/memory rather than instantiating
	  Or consider not instantiating at all and using class methods
